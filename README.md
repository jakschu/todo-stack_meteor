//TODO Stack
============

A micro-task manager—written in Meteor—for keeping track of things as they stack up throughout the day. Instead of putting things in a list, you put them in a stack.

Currently, password login or twitter login and manage your own independent stack.

Ported from my [backbone todo-stack app](https://github.com/mrcoles/todo-stack).
